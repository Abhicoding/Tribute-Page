        <p style="word-wrap:break-word; font-size: 1.25em; padding-left: 8.7em;   padding-right: 8.5em;">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. Fifth largest in the solar system and just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets.</p><br/>

        <p style="word-wrap:break-word; font-size: 1.25em; padding-left: 8.7em;   padding-right: 8.5em;">With an average radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets, and the fifth largest planet overall. From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), It takes about eight minutes
          for light from the sun to reach our planet.</p><br/>

        <p style="word-wrap:break-word; font-size: 1.25em; padding-left: 8.7em;   padding-right: 8.5em;">As Earth orbits the sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25 days to complete one trip around the sun. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun. This tilt
          causes our yearly cycle of seasons.</p><br/>

        <p style="word-wrap:break-word; font-size: 1.25em; padding-left: 8.7em;   padding-right: 8.5em;">Earth is composed of four main layers, starting with an inner core at the planet's center, enveloped by the outer core, mantle and crust.</br>The inner core is a solid sphere made of iron and nickel metals about 759 miles (1,221 kilometers) in
          radius. There the temperature is as high as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit (5,400 degrees Celsius). Surrounding the inner core is the outer core. This layer is about 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) thick, made of iron and nickel fluids.</br>In between
          the outer core and crust is the mantle, a hot, viscous mixture of molten rock is about 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) thick and has the consistency of caramel. The outermost layer, Earth's crust, goes about 19 miles (30 kilometers) deep on average
          on land. At the bottom of the ocean, the crust is thinner and extends about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the sea floor to the top of the mantle.</p><br/>

        <p style="word-wrap:break-word; font-size: 1.25em; padding-left: 8.7em;   padding-right: 8.5em;">About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by its oceans. The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and other sources of water.<br/>Near the surface, Earth has an atmosphere
          that consists of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, and 1 percent other gases such as argon, carbon dioxide and neon. The atmosphere affects Earth's long-term climate and short-term local weather and shields us from much of the harmful
          radiation coming from the sun. It also protects us from meteoroids, most of which burn up in the atmosphere.</p><br/>

        <p style="word-wrap:break-word; font-size: 1.25em; padding-left: 8.7em;   padding-right: 8.5em;">The Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like natural satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet.With a radius of 1,080 miles (1,738 kilometers),
          the moon is the fifth largest moon in our solar system.The moon is farther away from Earth than most people realize. The moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away. That means 30 Earth-sized planets could fit in between Earth
          and the moon.</p><br/>

        <p style="word-wrap:break-word; font-size: 1.25em; padding-left: 8.7em;   padding-right: 8.5em;">Earth is the only planet we know of that can support life. The planet is not too close or too far away from the sun. It lies in a "Goldilocks zone" that is just right — not too hot, not too cold. It is home to estimated 6.5 million species of
          organisms which live within various ecosystems on earth. An ecosystem consists of all the living and non-living things in a specific natural setting. Plants, animals, insects, microorganisms, rocks, soil, water and sunlight are major components
          of many ecosystems. All types of ecosystems fall into one of two categories: terrestrial or aquatic. Terrestrial ecosystems are land-based, while aquatic are water-based. The major types of ecosystems are forests, grasslands, deserts, tundra,
          freshwater and marine.</p>
